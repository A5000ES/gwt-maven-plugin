What's new in gwt-maven-plugin ${project.version}

 * Update to GWT 2.5.0-rc1
 
 * More GWT compiler options: <<<-Dgwt.persistentunitcache>>> and <<<-Dgwt.persistentunitcachedir>>>, <<<-XenableClosureCompiler>>>,
   <<<-XdisableAggressiveOptimization>>>, <<<-XcompilerMetrics>>>, <<<-XfragmentCount>>> (see the {{{./compile-mojo.html}Compile mojo}})  
 
 * New <<<genParam>>> configuration parameter to toggle the <<<-gen>>> off and cut I/O needs down by an order of magnitude (speeding up compilation)
 
 * New <<<quirksMode>>>, <<<userAgents>>> and <<<batch>>> parameters for the {{{./test-mojo.html}Test mojo}}
 
 * Support for {{{./run-codeserver-mojo.html} Super Dev Mode}} 
 
 * GWT's internal check for updates is disabled everywhere possible

 * {{{./css-mojo.html}Css mojo}} is now bound to the <<<generate-sources>>> phase by default
